One, two
One, two, three, four
We're swaying on horseback, the hills are green
And the birdies sing, and roses are pink
Experience I never had, I'm so happy
Happy to just be part of your story
After you, I follow
After you, I follow
The world you show me broaden my horizon
Forever my hero
Forever my hero
I am your biggest fan
I am your biggest fan
Merry-go-round in a circle I run
It's so much fun leaving reality behind
One, two
One, two, three, four
I fall down the horseback with my cripple legs
And then it starts to rain, showing me it's all fake
Raindrops wash down the facade hills are painted
Birdies are robotic, roses are made of clay
Excitement that I feel
Excitement that I feel
Return them to the shelf 'cause now I understand
Heroes cannot be real
Heroes cannot be real
I wasn't who I am
I don't know who I am
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Here we go another lap, prizes to claim
Here's a dream for you
Here's a dream for me
Golden tickets in my bag stay unchanged
Don't you love the thrill of the chase?
Just let me be your fan, I wanna be your fan
I'm still your biggest fan
Why is it that some were given the role of villain?
The moment they were released into this system?
One, two
One, two, three, four
Stand up, gallop on
Nothing can be done by feeling so sorry for myself
Hero on a plastic horse
Fighting like it's real with a cardboard sword
I know successful or not, I am who I am
I am my biggest fan
I am my biggest fan
I am my enemy and my friend
Hero gonna prove my version of justice
Is more just than yours
Uno remaining on this stage, I am the only one
I am my biggest fan
I am my biggest fan
I am my enemy and my friend
